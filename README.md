# Location Manager

I have created a Vacation-Location Manager console-based and GUI application that will help the user in keeping track of all the locations that they would like to visit!

Through this application the user can add and remove locations from their wishlist/collection. Easily navigate through 
a list of titles to choose and see more information about their choice of location.The user can mark a location as 
"visited" and can also rate the location on a scale of one to five stars.Similar locations will the grouped together
and the user can easily browse through the type of location they want to see.

This application can be used by someone who is planning a vacation and wants to compile a list of possible locations 
they would like to visit.The user can easily navigate through their collection and add or remove locations as 
they seem fit.

I chose this application for my term project because I myself have been thinking of going on a vacation when it is 
safe of travel again.I realize that this will probably take way longer than what any of us want
 or expect, but thinking of things that I'll be able to do with my family and friends once the pandemic is over is the 
 only thing that is keeping me hopeful at this time. I will be using this project as a way to implement the concepts 
 that we are learning in this course and also deciding the location that I want to visit next summer.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to select a location from my collection and view the location's details,
i.e. the location's name , type, rating and visiting status.

- As a user, I want to be able to save my collection to file.

- Phase 4: Task 2. Tested and designed a class(LocationCollection class) with method (rateLocation(Location l, int r)) 
in the model package that is robust(throws InvalidRatingException).  

- Phase 4: Task 3. If I had more time to work on this project,I would have: 
  1. changed the layout of the main GUI frame to make it more visually appealing
  
  2. added more frames that would have worked like pop-up windows to display more features
  
  3. increase the functionality of existing buttons so that more work is done when a button is clicked
